## Using R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a file format that allows you to put code and non-code together in one document. For example, the shaded area below contains some code. Click on the green arrow in the upper right corner of the shaded area to run the code:


```{r math}
# add numbers together
10 + 9
```

The result of running the code appears below the shaded area.

Outside the shaded area you can type text just like in any word processing program. 

The code, results, and text can be compiled into a single document by using the `Knit` button at the top of the pane. Try `Knit to html` to see what happens before you complete the challenge! You can also make pdf and word documents, but the formatting is more complicated and may not work unless you have other programs installed on your computer.

Before you begin, save this R Markdown file. The file extension for markdown files is .Rmd.

## Challenge 3

Write the code to answer each question in the shaded code chunks after the comment. Below the code chunks, write an interpretation of your results.

Start by running this code to import the data and examining the code book below:

```{r data}
# import the data and name it smokers
smokers <- read.csv("http://tinyurl.com/z2m3cgq",
                    sep = ",", header = TRUE)
```

Code book:

* id: survey participant unique identifier number 
* numcigs: number of cigarettes participant smokes per day 
* ageonset: age participant started smoking 
* yearssmoking: number of years participant has been smoking 
* packyears: equivalent to number of years participant has smoked 1 pack per day (1 pack year is 1 pack per day for 1 year or 2 packs per day for half a year, etc)
* age: age in years 
* yage: categories of age 
* marital_status: categories of marital status 
* employment: what sort of employment participant has
* Income: the amount of income the participant makes per year in 10 categories
* sex: the sex of the participant 
* VBMI4: The body mass index, or BMI, of the participant
* VBMI4CAT: participant category of BMI corresponding to CDC categories 
* vracegr: participant reported category of race 
* educa: amount of education the participant has 
* income2: the amount of income the participant makes per year in 7 categories 
* sexorien: the reported sexual orientation of the participant 
* rucacat: what sort of setting the participant lives in (e.g., rural, urban) 
* livesmoke: does participant live with one or more smokers 
* expsmoke: is participant exposed to secondhand smoke at home 
* smokehome: is smoking allowed in the participant's home 
* expsmokecar: is participant exposed to secondhand smoke in their car 
* nosmokecar: is smoking allowed in the participant's car 
* expwork: is participant exposed to secondhand smoke at work
* protctwrk: is smoking allowed in the participant's workplace 
* protctpub: is there a secondhand smoke policy restricting smoking in public places where the participant lives 
* strongerpol: does the participant support stronger secondhand smoke policies 
* final_wt_scale: survey weights 


(1) Use numbers and a graph to compare the number of cigarettes smoked per day (numcigs) by marital status (marital_status). Write 1-2 sentences interpreting your results.

```{r question1}
# cigarettes smoked per day by marital status

# graph of cigarettes smoked per day by marital status
```

Interpretation for 1: 

(2) Use the subset command to remove people with marital status of 9-Refused. Use the table command to see if it worked. Write a sentence interpreting the how many people were removed from the data frame.

```{r question2}
# subset data frame to delete 9-Refused marital status


# check to see if the subset command worked

```

Interpretation for 2: 

(3) Use appropriate numbers and graphs to describe the relationship between weight status (VBMI4CAT) and sex (sex). Interpret the results.

```{r question3}
# weight status by sex

# graph of weight status by sex
```

Interpretation for 3: 

(4) Use subset to remove people with weight status of "Tall" and check your results.

```{r question4}
# subset data frame to delete Tall weight status


# check to see if the subset command worked

```


(5) Use subset to remove blank values. Re-do the analysis from number (3). Compare the results with your results from number (3). Hint: to remove blank values, put nothing between the quote marks in the subset command

```{r question5}
# subset data frame to delete blank weight status

# check to see if the subset command worked

# weight status by sex


# graph of weight status by sex

```

Interpretation for 5: 

(6) Use appropriate numbers and graphs to describe the relationship between age (age) and years smoking (yearssmoking). Interpret your results.

```{r question6}
# relationship between age and years smoking

# graph of relationship between age and years smoking

```

Interpretation for 6: 

(7 question7) Take a subset of the data to delete the values of age that do not make sense and revise your graph and numbers from question 6. Explain what changed in your graph and numbers. Hint: to remove values of age that do not make sense, use age < 100 or something similar in the subset command

```{r}
# subset age to delete problematic values

# relationship between age and years smoking

# graph of relationship between age and years smoking 

```

Interpretation for 7:



Knit your document to check that it looks good. Make any edits needed. Once you are happy with the work, upload the R-Markdown file with the .Rmd file extension (not the knitted file) to Blackboard.
